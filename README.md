# Natural Language Processing Module
(LanguageProcessor.py)
This code provides a set of natural language processing (NLP) functions for text preprocessing and feature extraction. It initializes a Porter stemmer and WordNet lemmatizer for reducing words to their base form, and defines four main functions: tokenize for splitting sentences into individual words, clean_text for removing punctuation and special characters, stem for applying stemming or lemmatization to words, and bag_of_words for creating a binary vector representation of a sentence based on a given list of words. These functions can be used to preprocess text data and convert it into a format suitable for machine learning models.

#Deep Neural Network
(DeepNeuralNetwork.py)
This code implements a deep neural network using PyTorch, designed to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The network, defined in the DeepNeuralNet class, consists of five fully connected layers, each followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation function, with the output layer using Xavier initialization. The forward method defines the forward pass through the network, applying each layer in sequence, followed by the ReLU activation function and dropout. The example usage demonstrates how to train the network on the MNIST dataset, setting up hyperparameters, loading the dataset, defining the model, loss function, and optimizer, and enabling mixed precision training.
