# Natural Language Processing Module
This code provides a framework for preprocessing text data, which is a common step in NLP tasks. It allows for tokenization, cleaning, stemming, and creating a bag-of-words model, which can be useful for various applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. The use of stemming and lemmatization helps in reducing the dimensionality of the text data by consolidating different forms of a word into a single representation.
